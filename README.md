# Climate and Sustainability Trends: A Data-Driven Analysis of CO2, Energy, and Economic Indicators

## Overview
This project examines the relationship between climate change, renewable energy, and economic development, utilizing real-world datasets.
I’ve brought together data on CO₂ emissions, GDP per capita, renewable energy share, and population to study how different countries are progressing towards sustainability.

The aim of this project is:
1. Analyze global and regional patterns through data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
2. Build a foundation for predictive modeling (using Machine Learning in the next phase of this project).

The project is written in Python, with a focus on NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Objectives
1. Clean and prepare climate-related datasets for meaningful analysis.
2. Study sustainability trends across countries and over time.
3. Compare the progress of developed vs. developing nations.
4. Visualize trends in emissions, energy use, and economic growth.
5. Later, extend the project with ML models to forecast sustainability indicators.

## Project Structure
Climate-sustainability-analysis/
1. climate_data         # Raw and processed datasets
2. sustainability_study # Jupyter notebooks and scripts
3. outputs              # Visualizations, plots, and reports
4. README.md            # Project documentation

## Datasets Used
1. CO₂ Emissions Dataset – country-level emissions (total, per capita, per GDP, sector-wise)
2. GDP Dataset – GDP per capita by country and year
3. Renewable Energy Dataset – % of energy from renewables by country and year
4. Population Dataset – population growth by country and year

All datasets are taken from Our World in Data.

## Features 
1. Loaded and explored multiple datasets.
2. Dropped and renamed columns for consistency.
3. Handled missing values (dropping or interpolating, depending on country importance).
4. Started preparing the data for deeper analysis and visualization.

## Next Steps
1. Create meaningful visualizations to highlight sustainability patterns.
2. Study correlations (e.g., GDP vs CO₂ emissions, renewable energy vs growth).
3. Extend the project with ML models to predict CO₂ emissions and renewable adoption shortly.

## Sample Visualizations
1. CO₂ emissions trends across decades.
2. Heatmaps showing renewable energy adoption by region.
3. Scatter plots of GDP vs CO₂ emissions.

## Why This Project
This project is part of my journey towards AI/ML research internships.
I chose this topic because it connects real-world global issues with data science and machine learning. By starting with data analysis and later transitioning to predictive models, I aim to demonstrate both technical skills and domain expertise in climate sustainability.
